## 🚀 Session History

### Session #1 - 2025-06-15T18:09:46Z
**AI Agent**: Claude (Anthropic)  
**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Analyzed existing codebase structure
- ✅ Created new Git repository (removed old one)
- ✅ Uploaded project to GitHub: https://github.com/StephenConstantine/real-time-scanner
- ✅ Identified need for AI session continuity system
- 🔄 **CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING**: AI session tracking and code documentation system

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Chose to create fresh Git repo instead of fixing existing one
- Made repository public for easy sharing
- Identified need for better AI session memory between interactions

**Code Quality Observations**:
- Project has good modular structure
- Needs more inline comments and documentation
- Should implement emoji-based code readability system
- Missing comprehensive docstrings

**Next Steps Recommended**:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive code commenting with emojis
- [ ] Add detailed docstrings to all functions
- [ ] Create code architecture diagram
- [ ] Set up automated documentation generation

## 💡 AI Coding Best Practices for This Project

### 🎨 Code Style Guidelines
- Use emojis in comments for visual scanning: 🔍 🚀 ⚠️ 💡 🔧 📊 🎯
- Write self-documenting variable names
- Add inline comments explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- Include docstrings with examples for all functions
- Use type hints everywhere

### 🧠 Memory Aids for Future AI Sessions
- Always read this file first to understand project context
- Check `CODEBASE_MAP.md` for detailed module explanations
- Review recent Git commits for latest changes
- Update this log after every significant change

---

## 🔍 Current Technical Debt
- [ ] Missing comprehensive error handling
- [ ] No logging system implemented
- [ ] Limited test coverage
- [ ] Configuration management needs improvement
- [ ] API rate limiting not implemented

---

## 🎯 Known Issues & TODOs
- User mentioned prompts should be dynamic, not hardcoded
- Need to implement proper configuration system
- Requires better error handling and logging
- Should add comprehensive testing suite
